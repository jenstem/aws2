## Description

I wanted to a create an AWS + React app.  The app allows the user to add quotes and upload images to share with the world wide web.  Using AWS allows the app to handle the various components, i.e. uploading, viewing and deployment.  The DynamoDB handles the text, while the S3 bucket handles the uploaded images and the EC2 instance uploads the app to the AWS cloud.
